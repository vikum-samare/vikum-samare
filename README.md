🙋🏻 Hello! I’m a passionate Software Engineer based in Singapore, dedicated to bringing innovation to the prop-tech sector. By day, I specialize in building seamless, user-focused platforms with TypeScript and React Native. Here on GitHub, I use this space to share experiments and side projects that reflect my curiosity and excitement for software—usually worked on during my free time.

🌏 I love exploring new technologies and travelling to discover new perspectives, constantly seeking creative ways to push my skills further. If you’d like to connect or chat about tech trends (or travel!), my LinkedIn and Stack Overflow profiles are linked below!

**AI tools I vibe with:**
- ChatGPT _(coding and brainstorming)_
- GitHub Copilot _(rapid prototyping and code completion)_
- Perplexity AI (_research and deep dives_)
- Claude (_text corrections and refinements_)
