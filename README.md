### 👋 Hey there! I'm a passionate full-stack developer originally from the beautiful island of Sri Lanka 🇱🇰, now enjoying life in the bustling city-state of Singapore 🇸🇬.

#### 🏙️ Currently, I'm diving deep into the exciting world of PropTech, where technology meets real estate.

💻 This repo is my digital playground - a space where I tinker, experiment, and showcase my personal projects. It's a glimpse into my coding journey and the things that make me tick as a developer.

##### Feel free to explore and connect!
